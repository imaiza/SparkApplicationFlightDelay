# Spark application to predict flight delay:

In this project I use the python API for Spark, PySpark, to create an application that given a certain year’s flights dataset from http://stat‐ computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the‐data.html, trains the selected algorithm by the user and created a model capable of successfully predicting the arrival delay of the flights.

A also attach a file called "Intructions.pdf" with the instructions that explain how should the user execute the app.
